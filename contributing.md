# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute! ♥️ Ensure your PR adheres to following guidelines:

- Search included research papers before adding a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Only add papers you think are great! Feel welcome to remove entries that you think aren't great!
- Use the following format: `[Name (Year)](link) - Description.`
- Where `link` leads to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) page of the paper. If that is not available, then link directly to the PDF of the paper.
- The paper should be put into its appropriate category.
- The paper should be freely available.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- You can also add related links and repositories in the end.
